# Named-entity-recognition

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a classical method in natural language processing (NLP) that is widely used. For example, it is used to identify a person's name, place name from a sentence, identify the name of the product from an e-commerce search as well as to identify the name of the drug. The traditional well-known processing algorithm is conditional random field (CRF), which is a discriminant probability model. It is a kind of random field which is often used to annotate or analyze sequence data, such as natural language text or biological sequence. In short, the application in NER is to predict the labels of each word with a series of characteristics.

The steps of NER mainly include document preprocessing and entity recognition. Specifically, entity recognition includes two parts: entity mention and entity resolution. Entity mention is used to match naming libraries to specific naming in documents. Entity resolution is used to classify the specific names mentioned and the principle of classification is based on the entity linking method.
