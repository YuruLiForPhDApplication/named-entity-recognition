# named-entity-recognition

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a classical problem in natural language processing (NLP). It is widely used. For example, identify a person's name, place name from a sentence, identify the name of the product from an e-commerce search, identify the name of the drug and so on. The traditional well-known processing algorithm is conditional random field (CRF), which is a discriminant probability model. It is a kind of random field which often used to annotate or analyze sequence data, such as natural language text or biological sequence. In short, the application in NER is to predict the labels of each word with a series of characteristics. 
The steps are as follows:
